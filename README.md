# Godot-2DLights-Benchmark

This is a benchmark project for Godot 3.1s 2D Lighting implementation.

Hotkeys are on the left, you can change textures by editing the constants at the top of the Main.gd script.

All Light and Shadow parameters are exposed, and a basic performance monitor is included for exported projects.
